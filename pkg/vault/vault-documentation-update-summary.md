# EOS Vault Documentation Update Summary

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** Complete  
**Impact:** Critical - Production deployment guidance fundamentally changed

---

## Executive Summary

We have completed a comprehensive update of the EOS Vault documentation to address a **CRITICAL production readiness gap** identified in the red team review. The original specification recommended file storage, which is:

- ❌ **Not supported** in Vault Enterprise 1.12.0+
- ❌ **Not recommended** by HashiCorp for production
- ❌ **Lacks high availability** capabilities
- ❌ **Has no automatic failover**

The updated documentation now:
- ✅ **Recommends Raft (Integrated Storage)** as the primary storage backend
- ✅ **Provides comprehensive production deployment guidance**
- ✅ **Includes 5 detailed implementation documents**
- ✅ **Addresses all findings** from the red team review

---

## What Changed

### Version History

| Version | Storage Backend | Status | Use Case |
|---------|----------------|--------|----------|
| v0.0 (Original) | File (primary) | ❌ Not production-ready | Development only |
| v0.1 (Red Team Review) | File (identified as problematic) | ⚠️ Gaps identified | N/A |
| **v1.0 (Current)** | **Raft (primary)** | ✅ **Production-ready** | **All environments** |

   - **After:** Comprehensive Raft cluster setup with automatic failover

4. **Unsealing Strategy**
   - **Before:** Manual unsealing with stored keys only
   - **After:** Auto-unseal (AWS/Azure/GCP KMS) recommended for production

5. **Operational Procedures**
   - **Before:** Basic init/unseal only
   - **After:** Complete lifecycle management (backup, restore, monitoring, DR)

6. **Production Hardening**
   - **Before:** Minimal security guidance

## Critical Changes from Original Specification

### 1. Storage Backend Section

**Original (v0.0):**
```hcl
# File-based storage (suitable for single-node deployments)
storage "file" {
  path = "/opt/vault/data"
}
```
*No warnings about production usage*

**Updated (v1.0):**
```hcl
# ⚠️ DEVELOPMENT ONLY - NOT FOR PRODUCTION
storage "file" {
  path = "/opt/vault/data"
}

# RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION:
storage "raft" {
  path    = "/opt/vault/data"
  node_id = "eos-vault-node1"
  performance_multiplier = 1  # Production setting
}
```
*Prominent warnings + Raft examples*

---

### 2. Port Configuration

**Original:** 
- 8179 only (API)

**Updated:**
- 8179 (API)
- 8180 (Raft cluster communication) - **NEW**

**Impact:** Firewall rules must allow port 8180 between nodes

---

### 3. TLS Certificates

**Original:**
```bash
# Simple certificate
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout vault-key.pem -out vault-cert.pem \
  -subj "/CN=localhost"
```

**Updated:**
```bash
# Certificate with proper SANs (required for Raft)
# Must include:
# - All node IPs
# - All node hostnames
# - localhost and 127.0.0.1

# Uses configuration file with extensive SANs
```

**Impact:** Existing certificates may not work with Raft

---

### 4. Initialization

**Original:**
```bash
# Single node init
vault operator init -key-shares=5 -key-threshold=3
```

**Updated:**
```bash
# Multi-node cluster init
# 1. Initialize first node
# 2. Join additional nodes one by one
# 3. Unseal each node individually
# 4. Enable Autopilot

# OR use auto-unseal (recommended)
```

**Impact:** Multi-node initialization is more complex

---

### 5. Production Hardening

**Original:**
- Basic security only
- No production hardening guide

**Updated:**
- **LimitCORE=0** in systemd (prevent core dumps)
- **VAULT_ENABLE_FILE_PERMISSIONS_CHECK=1**
- Comprehensive security hardening checklist
- Compliance considerations (PCI-DSS, SOC2, HIPAA)

**Impact:** Production deployments need additional hardening steps

---

### 6. Backup and Restore

**Original:**
- No backup guidance
- File storage doesn't support snapshots

**Updated:**
- Raft snapshots are the **ONLY supported** backup method
- Automated snapshot scripts
- Enterprise automated snapshots
- Restore procedures with recovery scenarios

**Impact:** Proper backup strategy is essential

---

### 7. Monitoring

**Original:**
- Basic health checks only

**Updated:**
- Prometheus metrics
- Grafana dashboards
- Alert rules for:
  - Vault down
  - Vault sealed
  - No leader
  - Quorum loss
  - High latency
  - Leader changes

**Impact:** Production monitoring is comprehensive

---

## Migration Path for Existing Deployments

If you have existing Vault deployments using file storage:

### Development Environments
**Recommendation:** Migrate opportunistically when convenient

**Approach:**
1. Export current secrets
2. Destroy old Vault
3. Deploy new Raft-based Vault
4. Import secrets

**Downtime:** Acceptable (dev environment)

---

### Production Environments
**Recommendation:** Plan careful migration with maintenance window

**Approach:**
1. **Phase 1: Plan** (1-2 weeks)
   - Schedule maintenance window
   - Test migration in staging
   - Prepare rollback plan
   - Notify stakeholders

2. **Phase 2: Execute** (2-4 hours downtime)
   - Export all data
   - Deploy new Raft cluster
   - Import all data
   - Verify thoroughly

3. **Phase 3: Monitor** (1-2 weeks)
   - Monitor closely for issues
   - Keep old backup for rollback
   - Train team on new cluster

**Critical:** Follow migration procedure in main spec exactly
