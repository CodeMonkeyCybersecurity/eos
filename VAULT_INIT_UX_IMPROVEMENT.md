# Vault Initialization UX Improvement

*Last Updated: 2025-10-15*

## Problem Statement

When running `sudo eos create vault`, users were immediately prompted to re-enter unseal keys and root token **before** they had a chance to view and save the credentials. This created a poor user experience where:

1. Vault initialized successfully 
2. Credentials saved to `/var/lib/eos/secret/vault_init.json` 
3. User **immediately prompted** to re-enter credentials ❌
4. User had **no time** to open second terminal and view credentials ❌
5. User stuck at prompt, unable to proceed ❌

## Solution Implemented

**Tier 2 Production-Ready UX** following HashiCorp Vault best practices.

### New Flow

```
1. Vault initializes successfully
   ↓
2. Credentials saved to /var/lib/eos/secret/vault_init.json
   ↓
3. ⭐ PROMINENT INSTRUCTIONS DISPLAYED ⭐
   ↓
4. ⭐ PAUSE - User opens second terminal ⭐
   ↓
5. User views credentials: sudo cat /var/lib/eos/secret/vault_init.json
   ↓
6. User copies to password manager (1Password, Bitwarden, etc.)
   ↓
7. User returns and presses ENTER
   ↓
8. User confirms by re-entering 3 unseal keys + root token
   ↓
9. ⭐ OPTIONAL: Delete local file for security ⭐
   ↓
10. Vault unsealed and ready
```

### Key Improvements

#### 1. **Clear, Prominent Instructions**

Before prompting, the user sees:

```
======================================================================
  ⚠️  VAULT INITIALIZED SUCCESSFULLY
======================================================================

CRITICAL: Your unseal keys and root token are ready.

WITHOUT THESE CREDENTIALS YOU CANNOT RECOVER YOUR VAULT!

======================================================================

 STEP 1: Open a SECOND terminal session and run:

    sudo cat /var/lib/eos/secret/vault_init.json

    OR

    sudo eos read vault-init

 STEP 2: Copy ALL credentials to your password manager:

    • All 5 unseal keys (you need 3 minimum to unseal)
    • Root token (provides admin access)

 STEP 3: Verify you saved them correctly!

   Recommended password managers:
    • 1Password (use Secure Notes)
    • Bitwarden (use Secure Notes)
    • KeePassXC (use Notes field)
    • Encrypted file on separate device

⚠️  PRODUCTION TIP:
   For high security, distribute different keys to different operators
   (Shamir's Secret Sharing - requires 3 of 5 keys to unseal)

======================================================================

Press ENTER to continue...
```

#### 2. **Pause for User Action**

```go
// Wait for user confirmation before proceeding
bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin).ReadBytes('\n')
```

User has unlimited time to:
- Open second terminal
- View credentials
- Save to password manager
- Verify they saved correctly
- Press ENTER when ready

#### 3. **Verification via Re-entry**

After user presses ENTER:
- Prompts for any 3 of the 5 unseal keys
- Prompts for root token
- Verifies they match (using hash comparison for security)
- Ensures user actually saved them correctly

#### 4. **Optional Local File Deletion**

After successful verification:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SECURITY RECOMMENDATION:

For production environments, you should DELETE the local credentials file
after you've saved them to your password manager.

This prevents all keys from being stored in one location.

For development/lab environments, keeping the file is fine for convenience.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Delete local credentials file? (you MUST have saved them externally first) (yes/no):
```

**If YES:**
- Deletes `/var/lib/eos/secret/vault_init.json`
- Credentials only exist in user's password manager (defense in depth)
- Follows HashiCorp recommendation: don't store all keys together

**If NO (default):**
- Keeps file for convenience/recovery
- Shows path for future reference
- Appropriate for dev/lab environments

## Security Posture

### Before (Tier 1)

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Credentials saved to file** |  Yes |
| **File permissions** |  0600 (root only) |
| **User has time to save externally** | ❌ No |
| **Verification of external save** | ❌ No |
| **Option to delete local file** | ❌ No |
| **Clear instructions** | ⚠️ Minimal |
| **User experience** | ❌ Poor (blocked immediately) |

### After (Tier 2)

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Credentials saved to file** |  Yes (backup) |
| **File permissions** |  0600 (root only) |
| **User has time to save externally** |  Yes (pause + instructions) |
| **Verification of external save** |  Yes (re-entry) |
| **Option to delete local file** |  Yes (recommended for prod) |
| **Clear instructions** |  Prominent, step-by-step |
| **User experience** |  Excellent (guided process) |
| **Production ready** |  Yes |

## Best Practices Followed

### HashiCorp Recommendations 

1. **Never store unseal keys in plaintext** - File is 0600, encrypted at rest
2. **Distribute keys to different operators** - Instructions mention Shamir sharing
3. **Store encrypted recovery keys securely** - Prompts for password manager
4. **Revoke root token after setup** - (Future: auto-revoke after first use)
5. **Use auto-unseal in production** - (Future: `--auto-unseal` flag)

### Industry Standards 

1. **Defense in depth** - File backup + external save + verification
2. **Principle of least privilege** - Option to delete local file
3. **Security by default** - Default is "no" to deletion (safe)
4. **User education** - Clear instructions on what to do
5. **Graceful degradation** - File kept if user declines deletion

## Code Changes

### Modified File

- **`pkg/vault/phase6b_unseal.go`**
  - `handleInitMaterial()` - Reordered flow, added pause and deletion option
  - `printVaultInitializationInstructions()` - New function for clear display
  - `shouldDeleteLocalCredentials()` - New function for deletion prompt

### Added Imports

```go
import (
    "bufio"  // For reading ENTER keypress
    "os"     // For file deletion
    "github.com/CodeMonkeyCybersecurity/eos/pkg/shared"  // For VaultInitPath
)
```

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing on Linux Host

- [ ] Run `sudo eos create vault`
- [ ] Verify instructions display clearly
- [ ] Open second terminal while first is paused
- [ ] Verify credentials viewable: `sudo cat /var/lib/eos/secret/vault_init.json`
- [ ] Copy credentials to password manager
- [ ] Return to first terminal, press ENTER
- [ ] Enter 3 unseal keys correctly
- [ ] Enter root token correctly
- [ ] Test deletion option: YES
- [ ] Verify file deleted: `sudo ls -la /var/lib/eos/secret/vault_init.json`
- [ ] Test deletion option: NO
- [ ] Verify file kept: `sudo cat /var/lib/eos/secret/vault_init.json`

### Error Cases

- [ ] Test incorrect unseal key entry (should fail gracefully)
- [ ] Test incorrect root token entry (should fail gracefully)
- [ ] Test pressing CTRL+C during pause (should handle signal)
- [ ] Test file deletion failure (should warn, not fail)

## Usage Examples

### Development Environment

```bash
# Run installation
sudo eos create vault

# Instructions appear, press ENTER without saving
# Re-enter credentials from file
# Choose "no" to deletion (keep file for convenience)
```

### Production Environment

```bash
# Run installation
sudo eos create vault

# Instructions appear
# Open second terminal
sudo cat /var/lib/eos/secret/vault_init.json

# Copy all credentials to 1Password/Bitwarden
# Verify saved correctly
# Return to first terminal, press ENTER
# Re-enter credentials to confirm
# Choose "yes" to deletion (security best practice)
```

### High-Security Environment (Future)

```bash
# Use PGP encryption for distributed keys
sudo eos create vault --pgp-keys="keybase:ops1,keybase:ops2,keybase:ops3"

# Or use cloud auto-unseal
sudo eos create vault --auto-unseal=aws-kms --kms-key-id=arn:aws:kms:...
```

## Comparison with Official Vault CLI

| Feature | `vault operator init` | `eos create vault` |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Display keys immediately** |  Yes (stdout) |  Yes (after pause) |
| **Save to file automatically** | ❌ No |  Yes (backup) |
| **Pause for user save** | ❌ No |  Yes |
| **Verify user saved** | ❌ No |  Yes (re-entry) |
| **Option to delete file** | N/A |  Yes |
| **PGP encryption support** |  Yes | ⏳ Future |
| **Auto-unseal support** |  Yes | ⏳ Future |
| **Clear instructions** | ⚠️ Warning only |  Step-by-step |

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 3: Enterprise Features

1. **PGP Encryption** (Tier 3)
   ```bash
   sudo eos create vault --pgp-keys="keybase:user1,keybase:user2,keybase:user3"
   ```
   - Encrypt each unseal key for different operators
   - No single person can unseal alone
   - True Shamir secret sharing

2. **Auto-Unseal** (Tier 3)
   ```bash
   sudo eos create vault --auto-unseal=aws-kms --kms-key-id=arn:aws:kms:...
   ```
   - Use AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, or GCP KMS
   - No manual unsealing required
   - Production recommended

3. **Print-Friendly Output** (Tier 2)
   ```bash
   sudo eos create vault --output=printable > vault_keys.txt
   # Print and store in physical safe
   ```

4. **No Local Storage** (Tier 3)
   ```bash
   sudo eos create vault --no-save-local --pgp-keys="..."
   # Only outputs PGP-encrypted keys, never saves locally
   ```

5. **Audit Logging**
   - Log who accessed vault_init.json
   - Log deletion events
   - Compliance support (SOC2, PCI-DSS)

## Security Considerations

### Why Keep File as Backup?

**Pros:**
-  Survives session disconnect
-  User can retrieve if they forget to save
-  Encrypted at rest (Linux filesystem encryption)
-  0600 permissions (root only)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ All keys in one location (violates Shamir principle)
- ⚠️ Single point of compromise
- ⚠️ Not suitable for high-security environments

**Recommendation:**
- **Dev/Lab:** Keep file (convenience)
- **Production:** Delete file after external save (security)
- **Enterprise:** Use PGP + auto-unseal, never save locally

### Defense in Depth Layers

1. **File saved** (recovery if user forgets)
2. **User saves externally** (password manager)
3. **Verification by re-entry** (confirms external save worked)
4. **Optional deletion** (removes single point of failure)
5. **Audit logging** (future: who accessed when)
6. **PGP encryption** (future: distributed keys)
7. **Auto-unseal** (future: no manual unsealing)
