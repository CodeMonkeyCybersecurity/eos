# GitHub Actions Analysis and Recommendations

*Last Updated: 2025-10-21*

## Executive Summary

The Eos project has a comprehensive GitHub Actions setup with **14 workflow files** covering quality assurance, security, testing, and build automation. This analysis identifies issues, redundancies, and recommendations.

## Issues Found

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues

#### 1. **Build Failures Expected**
- **Location**: Multiple workflows (lint.yml, test.yml, quality-gates.yml, comprehensive-quality.yml)
- **Issue**: All workflows that run `go build ./...` or `go vet ./...` will fail due to missing Ceph dependencies
- **Error**: `fatal error: 'rados/librados.h' file not found`
- **Impact**: CI/CD pipeline is likely failing on every PR
- **Fix Required**: Either:
  - Add Ceph library dependencies to GitHub Actions runners
  - Exclude Ceph-dependent packages from build/vet
  - Use build tags to conditionally compile Ceph code

**Example Fix:**
```yaml
- name: Install Ceph dependencies
  run: |
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y librados-dev librbd-dev
```

Or exclude the problematic package:
```bash
go vet $(go list ./... | grep -v '/cephfs')
go build $(go list ./... | grep -v '/cephfs')
```

#### 2. **Duplicate/Overlapping Workflows**
Multiple workflows check the same things:

| Check | lint.yml | quality-gates.yml | comprehensive-quality.yml |
|-------|----------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| gofmt | âœ“ (warning) | âœ“ (fails) | âœ“ (fails) |
| go vet | âœ“ | implied | âœ“ |
| golangci-lint | âœ“ | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| gosec | - | âœ“ | - |
| test coverage | - | âœ“ (70%) | âœ“ (70%) |

**Recommendation**: Consolidate into a single quality workflow or clearly separate concerns:
- `lint.yml`: Fast formatting/linting only (non-blocking)
- `quality-gates.yml`: PR quality requirements (blocking)
- `comprehensive-quality.yml`: Daily/scheduled deep analysis (non-blocking)

### ðŸŸ¡ Warning Issues

#### 3. **Inconsistent Go Version**
- All workflows use `go-version: 1.24`
- Go 1.24 doesn't exist yet (current stable is 1.23)
- **Impact**: May use pre-release or fallback to latest
- **Fix**: Update to `go-version: '1.23'` or use `go-version-file: go.mod`

#### 4. **Coverage Threshold Conflicts**
- `quality-gates.yml`: 70% minimum coverage
- `comprehensive-quality.yml`: 70% overall, 90% for critical packages (vault, crypto, eos_io, eos_err)
- **Issue**: Critical package threshold (90%) is very high and may be failing
- **Recommendation**: Review if 90% is achievable or lower to 80%

#### 5. **Security Tool Redundancy**
Security scanning is split across multiple workflows:

| Tool | security.yml | comprehensive-quality.yml |
|------|-------------|---------------------------|
| gosec | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| govulncheck | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| staticcheck | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| trufflehog | âœ“ | - |
| nancy | âœ“ | - |
| semgrep | âœ“ | - |
| trivy | - | âœ“ |
| CodeQL | âœ“ (conditional) | - |

**Recommendation**: Consolidate all security scanning into `comprehensive-quality.yml` security job

#### 6. **Test Coverage Workflow Issues**
- `coverage-enforcement.yml` (if exists) may duplicate coverage checks
- Multiple workflows upload to Codecov (test.yml, comprehensive-quality.yml)
- **Issue**: Multiple uploads may cause conflicts or overcounting
- **Fix**: Upload coverage from only one workflow per trigger

### ðŸ”µ Informational Issues

#### 7. **Missing Workflow Triggers**
Some workflows don't run on all relevant events:

- `lint.yml`: Only runs on `*.go` and `.golangci.yml` changes
  - **Missing**: `go.mod`, `go.sum` changes should also trigger

- `test.yml`: Only runs on `main` branch pushes/PRs
  - **Missing**: Should also run on `develop` or feature branches

#### 8. **Build Matrix May Be Excessive**
`comprehensive-quality.yml` builds for:
- linux/amd64, linux/arm64
- darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64
- windows/amd64

**Issue**: 5 builds per workflow run may be slow
**Recommendation**: Only build all platforms on:
- Releases/tags
- Daily scheduled runs
- PR builds should only build linux/amd64 for speed

#### 9. **Missing Workflow Features**

**Caching:**
- Most workflows don't cache Go modules
- Only `comprehensive-quality.yml` uses `actions/cache@v4`
- **Impact**: Slower CI runs, more bandwidth usage
- **Fix**: Add Go module caching to all workflows

**Example:**
```yaml
- name: Cache Go modules
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/go/pkg/mod
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-go-${{ hashFiles('**/go.sum') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-go-
```

**Concurrency Control:**
- No workflows use `concurrency` to cancel outdated runs
- Multiple pushes to a PR will queue all workflow runs
- **Fix**: Add concurrency groups

**Example:**
```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

## New Features Added

### âœ… Emoji Enforcement

#### Pre-Commit Hook
- **Location**: `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
- **Source**: `.github/hooks/pre-commit`
- **Function**: Automatically removes emojis from staged Go files before commit
- **Test File Exemption**: Skips `*_test.go` and `test/` directories
- **Installation**: Run `./.github/hooks/setup-hooks.sh`

#### GitHub Action
- **Location**: `.github/workflows/emoji-check.yml`
- **Triggers**: PRs and pushes to main with Go/MD changes
- **Function**:
  - Runs `.github/hooks/remove-emojis.sh --dry-run`
  - Comments on PRs if emojis found
  - Fails build if emojis detected
  - Uploads detailed report as artifact

#### Setup Script
- **Location**: `.github/hooks/setup-hooks.sh`
- **Function**: Installs pre-commit hook for developers
- **Usage**: `./.github/hooks/setup-hooks.sh`

## Recommended Workflow Structure

### Minimal Required Workflows (Fast)

1. **`quick-checks.yml`** - Fast PR validation (< 2 min)
   - gofmt check (fail)
   - golangci-lint (fail)
   - go vet (selective, excluding Ceph)
   - Emoji check

2. **`test.yml`** - Unit tests (< 5 min)
   - Unit tests with coverage
   - Upload to Codecov
   - Fail if coverage < 70%

3. **`build.yml`** - Build verification (< 3 min)
   - Build linux/amd64 only (excluding Ceph packages)
   - Verify binary works

### Comprehensive Workflows (Scheduled/Release)

4. **`comprehensive-quality.yml`** - Deep analysis (daily/release)
   - All security tools
   - All platforms build
   - Critical package coverage (90%)
   - Documentation validation
   - Release readiness

5. **`security.yml`** - Security scanning (daily)
   - Move all security tools here
   - Run on schedule and security-related changes

## Recommended Fixes

### Priority 1: Fix Ceph Build Failures

Add to all workflows that build/vet:

```yaml
- name: Install Ceph dependencies
  run: |
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y librados-dev librbd-dev

# OR exclude Ceph packages
- name: Build (excluding Ceph)
  run: go build $(go list ./... | grep -v '/cephfs')
```

### Priority 2: Add Caching

Add to all workflows after `setup-go`:

```yaml
- name: Cache Go modules
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.cache/go-build
      ~/go/pkg/mod
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-go-${{ hashFiles('**/go.sum') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-go-
```

### Priority 3: Add Concurrency Control

Add to PR-triggered workflows:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

### Priority 4: Consolidate Security Scanning

Move all security tools to one workflow, run on schedule:

```yaml
name: Security Scan
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily at 2 AM
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - '**.go'
      - 'go.mod'
      - 'go.sum'
```

## Metrics

### Current State
- **Total Workflows**: 14
- **Estimated PR CI Time**: 20-30 minutes (with failures)
- **Estimated Daily CI Time**: 45-60 minutes
- **Build Failures**: Expected on all workflows (Ceph dependency)

### After Recommended Changes
- **Total Workflows**: 5-6 (consolidated)
- **Estimated PR CI Time**: 8-12 minutes
- **Estimated Daily CI Time**: 30-40 minutes
- **Build Failures**: None (Ceph handled)

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Merging
1. Test emoji-check workflow on a branch with emojis
2. Verify pre-commit hook works locally
3. Test setup-hooks.sh script
4. Check that Ceph fix resolves build failures

### After Merging
1. Monitor workflow run times
2. Check for Codecov upload conflicts
3. Verify security scans complete successfully
4. Review coverage reports for accuracy

## Notes

- The emoji enforcement aligns with CLAUDE.md requirements
- Security scanning is comprehensive but redundant
- Build failures are blocking all CI/CD - highest priority fix
- Consider using `go-version-file: go.mod` for version management
- GitHub Actions usage costs may be high with current duplication
