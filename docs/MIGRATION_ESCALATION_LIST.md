# Eos Migration Escalation List

## Complex Cases Requiring Architectural Decisions

### Priority 1: System-Level Operations (Requires Administrator Escalation)

#### 1. User Management Operations
**Files:** `cmd/create/user.go`, `pkg/users/operations.go`
**Complexity:** High - System user creation, SSH key management, sudo configuration
**Current Status:** Escalation patterns implemented
**Recommendation:** Keep administrator escalation pattern
**Rationale:** System user operations require root privileges and security validation

#### 2. Storage Management Operations  
**Files:** `pkg/storage/monitor/_disk_manager.go`, `pkg/storage/manager_lvm.go`
**Complexity:** Very High - LVM management, filesystem operations, disk partitioning
**Current Status:** Basic escalation implemented
**Recommendation:** Hybrid approach - Nomad for application storage, escalation for system storage
**Rationale:** Complex state management and root privileges required

#### 3. System Updates and Package Management
**Files:** `cmd/update/system.go`
**Complexity:** High - OS package management, security updates, system configuration
**Current Status:** Escalation patterns implemented
**Recommendation:** Keep administrator escalation pattern
**Rationale:** System-level changes require careful validation and rollback capabilities

#### 4. Security Hardening Operations
**Files:** `pkg/system/security.go`
**Complexity:** High - Firewall rules, SELinux/AppArmor, system hardening
**Current Status:** Escalation patterns implemented
**Recommendation:** Keep administrator escalation pattern
**Rationale:** Security policies require privileged access and audit trails

### Priority 2: Distributed Systems (Complex Orchestration)

#### 5. CephFS Cluster Management
**Files:** `pkg/cephfs/.go`, `cmd/create/storage_cephfs.go`
**Complexity:** Very High - Distributed storage cluster coordination
**Current Status:** Placeholder implementations
**Recommendation:** Nomad job orchestration with Consul coordination
**Implementation Strategy:**
- Use Nomad for CephFS daemon scheduling
- Consul for cluster membership and health monitoring
- Vault for CephFS authentication keys
- Custom orchestration logic for cluster formation

#### 6. Multi-Node Service Coordination
**Files:** Various service deployment files
**Complexity:** Medium-High - Cross-node dependencies and ordering
**Current Status:** Individual service implementations complete
**Recommendation:** Nomad job dependencies with Consul Connect
**Implementation Strategy:**
- Use Nomad job dependencies for ordering
- Consul Connect for service mesh communication
- Health checks for readiness validation

### Priority 3: Legacy Integration (Compatibility Layer)

#### 7. Secrets Management Migration
**Files:** `pkg/secrets/manager.go`, `cmd/update/secrets.go`
**Complexity:** Medium - Vault integration with legacy secret formats
**Current Status:** Basic Vault integration implemented
**Recommendation:** Gradual migration with compatibility layer
**Implementation Strategy:**
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing secret formats
- Implement Vault as primary secret store
- Migration utilities for existing secrets

#### 8. Environment Discovery and Configuration
**Files:** `pkg/environment/enhanced_discovery.go`, `pkg/environment/discovery.go`
**Complexity:** Medium - Dynamic environment detection and adaptation
**Current Status:** Basic implementations
**Recommendation:** Consul-based service discovery with Nomad integration
**Implementation Strategy:**
- Use Consul catalog for service discovery
- Nomad allocation metadata for environment detection
- Dynamic configuration via Consul KV

### Priority 4: Monitoring and Observability (Enhancement Opportunities)

#### 9. Comprehensive Health Monitoring
**Files:** Various health check implementations
**Complexity:** Medium - Unified health monitoring across HashiCorp stack
**Current Status:** Individual component health checks
**Recommendation:** OpenTelemetry integration with Consul health checks
**Implementation Strategy:**
- OpenTelemetry for metrics and tracing
- Consul health checks for service availability
- Nomad job health monitoring
- Unified dashboard via Grafana

#### 10. Audit and Compliance Logging
**Files:** Various logging implementations
**Complexity:** Medium - Comprehensive audit trails for compliance
**Current Status:** Basic structured logging
**Recommendation:** Enhanced audit logging with Vault audit backend
**Implementation Strategy:**
- Vault audit logs for secret access
- Consul audit logs for service discovery changes
- Nomad audit logs for job scheduling
- Centralized log aggregation

## Decision Framework

### When to Use HashiCorp Stack
‚úÖ **Application Services**: Container orchestration, service discovery, configuration
‚úÖ **Distributed Applications**: Multi-node coordination, service mesh, load balancing
‚úÖ **Development Workflows**: CI/CD integration, testing environments, staging
‚úÖ **Cloud-Native Workloads**: Microservices, API gateways, data processing

### When to Escalate to Administrator
‚ö†Ô∏è **System Operations**: User management, package installation, system configuration
‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Operations**: Firewall rules, access controls, security policies
‚ö†Ô∏è **Storage Operations**: Disk partitioning, filesystem creation, hardware management
‚ö†Ô∏è **Network Operations**: Interface configuration, routing, DNS management

### Hybrid Approach Examples
üîÑ **Database Services**: Nomad for container orchestration + Admin escalation for system tuning
üîÑ **Storage Services**: Nomad for application storage + Admin escalation for disk management
üîÑ **Monitoring Services**: Nomad for monitoring stack + Admin escalation for system metrics
üîÑ **Backup Services**: Nomad for backup orchestration + Admin escalation for storage access

## Conclusion

The Eos migration to HashiCorp stack has successfully established a solid foundation with clear architectural boundaries. The remaining escalation cases represent opportunities for enhanced functionality while maintaining the security and reliability principles that make Eos a robust infrastructure management platform.

The hybrid architecture approach ensures that:
- Application services benefit from modern orchestration capabilities
- System-level operations maintain necessary security controls
- Operational complexity is managed through clear escalation patterns
- Future enhancements can be implemented incrementally without disrupting existing functionality
