# Systematic Hardware Requirements Calculator

*Last Updated: 2025-01-19*

## Overview

This document describes the new systematic hardware requirements calculator that replaces the previous "finger in the air" approach with a methodical, documented system based on researched requirements from official sources.

## Problem Statement

Previously, Eos used estimated hardware requirements without clear documentation of how those numbers were derived. This led to:

- **Unreliable sizing**: Requirements were guesswork rather than based on documented specifications
- **No transparency**: Users couldn't understand how requirements were calculated
- **No source attribution**: No way to verify or update requirements as software evolved
- **Inflexibility**: Hard to adapt to different workload sizes or deployment scenarios

## Solution: Systematic Requirements Calculator V2

The new calculator provides:

### 1. Documented Requirements Database

Every component has researched requirements with source attribution:

```go
"postgresql_16": {
    Component: "PostgreSQL 16",
    Version:   "16.x",
    ServiceReqs: ServiceRequirements{
        Service: ServiceDefinition{
            BaseRequirements: ResourceRequirements{
                CPU:    CPURequirements{Cores: 2.0, Type: "compute"},
                Memory: MemoryRequirements{GB: 4.0, Type: "high-performance"},
                Disk:   DiskRequirements{GB: 200, Type: "ssd", IOPS: 3000},
            },
        },
    },
    References: []RequirementReference{
        {
            Source:      "official_docs",
            URL:         "https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/install-requirements.html",
            Description: "PostgreSQL official documentation on system requirements",
            Date:        "2025-01-19",
        },
    },
    Notes: "Requirements for typical Authentik workload. Minimum 2GB production, 4GB recommended, 8GB for better performance",
}
```

### 2. Calculation Transparency

The calculator shows every step of its work:

```
=== Hardware Requirements Calculation Report ===

• Total Memory: 25.6 GB
• Total Storage: 380.0 GB
• Recommended Nodes: 2
• Per-Node Specs: 8 cores, 16 GB memory, 200 GB storage

OS BASELINE (Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS):

• Memory: 2.4 GB
• Storage: 12.0 GB

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
• PostgreSQL 16:
  - Baseline: 2.0 cores, 4.0 GB memory, 200.0 GB storage
  - After scaling: 6.0 cores, 12.0 GB memory, 300.0 GB storage
  - Notes: Requirements for typical Authentik workload...

SCALING FACTORS APPLIED:
• Environment factor (production): 2.0x
• Growth buffer: 1.5x
• Peak load buffer: 2.5x
• Total multiplier: 7.5x
```

### 3. Source Attribution

Every requirement includes references to official documentation, community analysis, or measured benchmarks:

- **Ubuntu Server 24.04**: Official system requirements documentation
- **PostgreSQL 16**: Official documentation + community best practices
- **Caddy**: Community benchmarks + measured performance data
- **HashiCorp Stack**: Official reference architectures

### 4. Pre-configured Profiles

Common deployment scenarios are pre-configured with appropriate scaling:

```go
// Hecate small production deployment
breakdown, err := sizing.CalculateHecateRequirements(rc, "small_production")

// HashiCorp Vault cluster
breakdown, err := sizing.CalculateServiceRequirements(rc, sizing.ServiceProfileTypeVault, "production")

// Custom deployment
calc := sizing.NewCalculatorV2(sizing.WorkloadMedium, "production")
calc.AddComponent("ubuntu_server_24.04")
calc.AddComponent("postgresql_16")
```

## Implementation Details

### Requirements Database

Location: `pkg/sizing/requirements_database.go`

Contains researched requirements for:
- **Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS**: Base OS requirements
- **Caddy Reverse Proxy**: Lightweight Go-based proxy
- **PostgreSQL 16**: Database requirements for typical workloads
- **Redis 7**: Session cache requirements
- **Authentik SSO**: Python/Django SSO server requirements
- **HashiCorp Stack**: Consul, Vault, Nomad cluster requirements

### Systematic Calculator

Location: `pkg/sizing/calculator_v2.go`

Provides:
- Step-by-step calculation breakdown
- Workload-based scaling
- Environment-specific factors (dev/staging/production)
- Node placement recommendations
- Validation and warnings

### Service Integration

Location: `pkg/sizing/hecate_integration.go`, `pkg/sizing/service_profiles.go`

Provides:
- Pre-configured Hecate deployment profiles
- Extensible service profile framework
- Validation against current system specs
- Human-readable reports

## Usage Examples

### Hecate Deployment Sizing

```go
// Calculate requirements for medium production Hecate
breakdown, err := sizing.CalculateHecateRequirements(rc, "medium_production")
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// Generate detailed report
report, err := sizing.GenerateHecateRecommendationReport(rc, "medium_production")
fmt.Println(report)

// Validate against current system
currentSystem := sizing.NodeSpecification{
    CPUCores: 16,
    MemoryGB: 64,
    DiskGB:   1000,
    DiskType: "ssd",
}

errors, err := sizing.ValidateHecateRequirements(rc, "medium_production", currentSystem)
if len(errors) > 0 {
    // Handle insufficient resources
}
```

### Custom Service Calculation

```go
// Create calculator for specific workload
calc := sizing.NewCalculatorV2(sizing.WorkloadLarge, "production")

// Add required components
calc.AddComponent("ubuntu_server_24.04")
calc.AddComponent("vault_cluster")
calc.AddComponent("consul_cluster")

// Apply custom scaling if needed
calc.SetCustomScalingFactors("vault_cluster", sizing.ScalingFactors{
    SafetyMargin: 2.0, // Higher safety margin for secrets
})

// Define workload characteristics
workload := sizing.WorkloadCharacteristics{
    ConcurrentUsers:   500,
    RequestsPerSecond: 100,
    DataGrowthGB:      50.0,
    PeakMultiplier:    3.0,
    Type:             sizing.WorkloadLarge,
}

// Calculate with full breakdown
breakdown, err := calc.Calculate(rc, workload)

// Get detailed report showing all calculation steps
report := calc.GenerateHumanReadableReport()
```
