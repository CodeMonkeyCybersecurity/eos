## Quick Reference

For detailed documentation, see the inline comments in these files:

- **Bootstrap Check**: `pkg/bootstrap/check.go` - Machine preparation and validation system
- **System Bootstrap**: `pkg/bootstrap/system_bootstrap.go` - Core bootstrap functionality
- **State Validation**: `pkg/bootstrap/state_validator.go` - Bootstrap state verification
- **Safety Mechanisms**: `pkg/bootstrap/safety.go` - Bootstrap safety controls

## Overview

The Eos bootstrap system ensures machines are properly prepared before deploying services. This prevents common errors like " state files not found" and ensures a consistent, secure foundation for all deployments.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check bootstrap status
eos bootstrap --check

# Run bootstrap process
eos bootstrap

# Verify bootstrap completion
eos bootstrap --verify
```

## Key Components

- **Machine Preparation**: Ensures proper system state before service deployment
- ** Setup**: Installs and configures configuration management
- **API Configuration**: Sets up secure communication channels
- **Security Baseline**: Applies initial security hardening
- **State Validation**: Verifies bootstrap completion
