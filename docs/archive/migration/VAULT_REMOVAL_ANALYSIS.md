# Vault Removal Implementation - Critical Analysis

*Last Updated: 2025-10-06*

## Requirements vs Implementation Comparison

###  IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY

#### 1. Service Management
**Requirement:**
```bash
systemctl stop vault
systemctl disable vault
rm -f /etc/systemd/system/vault.service
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl reset-failed vault.service
```

**Implementation:** [pkg/vault/uninstall.go:148-200](pkg/vault/uninstall.go#L148-L200)
```go
// Stop() method covers:
 systemctl stop vault
 systemctl stop vault-agent
 systemctl disable vault
 systemctl disable vault-agent
 pkill -f vault (cleanup remaining processes)
 Remove service files from multiple locations:
   - /etc/systemd/system/vault.service
   - /etc/systemd/system/vault-agent.service
   - /lib/systemd/system/vault.service
   - /usr/lib/systemd/system/vault.service
 systemctl reset-failed vault.service
 systemctl reset-failed vault-agent.service
```

**Status:**  **COMPLETE** - Actually better than requirements (covers more service file locations)

#### 2. Configuration Directory
**Requirement:** `rm -rf /etc/vault.d/`

**Implementation:** [pkg/vault/phase_delete.go:33](pkg/vault/phase_delete.go#L33)
```go
shared.VaultConfigPath,  // "/etc/vault.d/vault.hcl"
```

**Covered by:** `GetVaultPurgePaths()` ‚Üí Purge()

**Status:**  **COMPLETE** - Removes entire `/etc/vault.d/` via parent directory

#### 3. Data and Operational Directories
**Requirement:** `rm -rf /opt/vault/`

**Implementation:** [pkg/vault/phase_delete.go:42](pkg/vault/phase_delete.go#L42)
```go
shared.VaultDataPath,  // "/opt/vault/data/"
```

**Also includes:** [pkg/vault/phase_delete.go:25](pkg/vault/phase_delete.go#L25)
```go
shared.VaultDir,  // "/opt/vault/"
```

**Status:**  **COMPLETE** - Removes entire `/opt/vault/` directory tree

#### 4. Log Files
**Requirement:** `rm -rf /var/log/vault/`

**Implementation:** [pkg/vault/phase_delete.go:24](pkg/vault/phase_delete.go#L24)
```go
shared.VaultLogWildcard,  // Wildcard for log files
```

**Status:**  **COMPLETE** - Covered by wildcard

#### 5. Binary Removal
**Requirement:** `rm -f /usr/local/bin/vault`

**Implementation:** [pkg/vault/phase_delete.go:43](pkg/vault/phase_delete.go#L43)
```go
shared.VaultBinaryPath,  // Defined as "/usr/bin/vault" in shared constants
```

**ISSUE FOUND:**
- Shared constants define `/usr/bin/vault`
- Install.go actually installs to `/usr/local/bin/vault`
- Requirements specify `/usr/local/bin/vault`

**Status:** **PARTIAL** - Only removes `/usr/bin/vault`, misses `/usr/local/bin/vault`

#### 6. User and Group Removal
**Requirement:**
```bash
userdel vault
groupdel vault
```

**Implementation:** [pkg/vault/uninstall.go:262-286](pkg/vault/uninstall.go#L262-L286)
```go
 userdel -r vault  // -r removes home directory too (better than requirement)
 groupdel vault
 Error handling for non-existent user/group
```

**Status:**  **COMPLETE** - Actually better (removes home directory)

#### 7. Environment Variable Cleanup
**Requirement:**
```bash
sed -i '/VAULT_ADDR/d' /etc/environment
sed -i '/VAULT_CACERT/d' /etc/environment
sed -i '/VAULT_ADDR/d' /etc/profile.d/vault.sh
rm -f /etc/profile.d/vault.sh
```

**Implementation:** [pkg/vault/uninstall.go:288-342](pkg/vault/uninstall.go#L288-L342)
```go
 Removes from /etc/environment: VAULT_ADDR, VAULT_CACERT
 Also removes: VAULT_CLIENT_CERT, VAULT_CLIENT_KEY, VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY, VAULT_TOKEN
 rm -f /etc/profile.d/vault.sh
 sed operations with error handling
```

**Status:**  **COMPLETE** - Actually more comprehensive than requirements

#### 8. systemd Reload
**Requirement:** `systemctl daemon-reload`

**Implementation:**
- [pkg/vault/uninstall.go:345-348](pkg/vault/uninstall.go#L345-L348)
- [pkg/vault/phase_delete.go:179](pkg/vault/phase_delete.go#L179)

**Status:**  **COMPLETE** - Called in both Uninstall() and Purge()

---

## üî¥ ISSUES FOUND

### Issue #1: Binary Path Inconsistency (P0 - CRITICAL)

**Problem:** Code uses `/usr/bin/vault` but actually installs to `/usr/local/bin/vault`

**Evidence:**
```go
// shared/vault_server.go:40
VaultBinaryPath = "/usr/bin/vault"

// vault/install.go:119
config.BinaryPath = "/usr/local/bin/vault"  // ‚Üê DIFFERENT!
```

**Impact:** After `eos delete vault`, the binary at `/usr/local/bin/vault` remains on the system.

**Fix Required:**
```go
// Option 1: Add both locations to purge paths
func GetVaultPurgePaths() []string {
    return []string{
        // ... existing paths ...
        "/usr/bin/vault",        // Old location
        "/usr/local/bin/vault",  // Current installation location
    }
}

// Option 2: Use binary_cleanup's findVaultBinaries() to find ALL locations
```

**Recommended Fix:** Use the existing `FindVaultBinaries()` function from binary_cleanup.go

### Issue #2: TLS Certificate Directory May Be Missed (P1 - CRITICAL)

**Problem:** Requirements mention TLS certs in two locations:
- `/etc/vault.d/tls/vault.crt` and `/etc/vault.d/tls/vault.key`
- `/opt/vault/tls/tls.crt` and `/opt/vault/tls/tls.key`

**Current Implementation:**
```go
shared.TLSDir,  // "/opt/vault/tls/" - ONLY covers /opt/vault/tls/
```

**Missing:** `/etc/vault.d/tls/` is not explicitly in the purge list

**Why It Still Works:** `/etc/vault.d/` parent directory is removed, so TLS certs ARE deleted

**Status:**  **ACTUALLY OK** - Parent directory removal handles this

### Issue #3: Deprecated systemd Capabilities Syntax (P2 - IMPORTANT)

**Problem:** Requirements mention fixing `Capabilities=` ‚Üí `AmbientCapabilities=`

**This is an INSTALLATION issue, not removal issue** - but should be fixed.

**Location:** Vault systemd service file generation

**Current:** Unknown (need to check install.go service file generation)

**Required Change:**
```systemd
# OLD (deprecated):
Capabilities=CAP_IPC_LOCK+ep

# NEW (correct):
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_IPC_LOCK
```

---

## üü¢ STRENGTHS OF CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION

### 1. **Idempotency**
All operations use `-f` flags or error handling to be safe to run multiple times.

### 2. **Edge Case Handling**
- Checks if service exists before stopping
- Checks if user exists before deleting
- Handles missing directories gracefully
- Cleans up failed systemd units

### 3. **Comprehensive Path Coverage**
Goes beyond requirements:
- Removes vault-agent in addition to vault
- Cleans up snap installations
- Removes vault PID files
- Cleans systemd trust store
- Handles legacy config wildcards

### 4. **Proper Logging**
Every operation is logged with structured logging (zap)

### 5. **Verification Step**
`Verify()` method checks for remaining components after deletion

### 6. **Safety Features**
- Double confirmation prompt (y/N + type 'DELETE')
- Force flag for automation
- Non-fatal errors don't stop the entire process

---

## TESTING CHECKLIST

Based on user requirements, verify after `eos delete vault`:

### Service and systemd
- [ ] `systemctl status vault` shows "Unit vault.service could not be found"
- [ ] `/etc/systemd/system/vault.service` does not exist
- [ ] `systemctl is-enabled vault` returns error (not found)
- [ ] No failed units: `systemctl list-units --failed | grep vault` returns nothing

### Files and Directories
- [ ] `/etc/vault.d/` does not exist
- [ ] `/opt/vault/` does not exist
- [ ] `/usr/local/bin/vault` does not exist **‚Üê CURRENTLY FAILS**
- [ ] `/usr/bin/vault` does not exist
- [ ] `/var/log/vault/` does not exist

### User and Group
- [ ] `id vault` shows "no such user"
- [ ] `getent group vault` returns nothing

### Environment Variables
- [ ] No VAULT_* variables in `/etc/environment`
- [ ] `/etc/profile.d/vault.sh` does not exist
- [ ] `/etc/profile.d/eos_vault.sh` does not exist

### Reinstallation
- [ ] Can successfully run `eos create vault` without conflicts
- [ ] No "already exists" errors during reinstallation

---

##  REQUIRED FIXES

### Priority 0 - BREAKING (Must Fix)

**FIX #1: Binary Path Coverage**

Add `/usr/local/bin/vault` to purge paths:

```go
// File: pkg/vault/phase_delete.go
// Line 43-44

func GetVaultPurgePaths() []string {
    return []string{
        shared.VaultConfigPath,
        // ... existing paths ...
        shared.VaultBinaryPath,           // "/usr/bin/vault"
        "/usr/local/bin/vault",           // ADD THIS LINE
        // ... rest of paths ...
    }
}
```

**Alternative (Better):** Use `FindVaultBinaries()` and remove ALL found binaries:

```go
// File: pkg/vault/uninstall.go
// Add new method:

func (vu *VaultUninstaller) RemoveAllBinaries() error {
    vu.logger.Info("Finding and removing all Vault binaries")

    binaries, err := FindVaultBinaries(vu.rc)
    if err != nil {
        vu.logger.Warn("Could not find vault binaries", zap.Error(err))
        return nil // Non-fatal
    }

    for _, binary := range binaries {
        vu.logger.Info("Removing vault binary", zap.String("path", binary.Path))
        if err := os.Remove(binary.Path); err != nil && !os.IsNotExist(err) {
            vu.logger.Warn("Failed to remove binary",
                zap.String("path", binary.Path),
                zap.Error(err))
        }
    }

    return nil
}
```

Then call it in `Uninstall()` after `Stop()`.

### Priority 1 - CRITICAL (Should Fix)

**FIX #2: Deprecated systemd Capabilities**

This is in the INSTALLATION code, not removal:

```go
// File: pkg/vault/install.go
// Search for "Capabilities=" in service file generation

// Change from:
Capabilities=CAP_IPC_LOCK+ep

// To:
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_IPC_LOCK
```

##  IMPLEMENTATION QUALITY SCORE

**Overall: 9/10**

| Category | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Completeness | 9/10 | Missing /usr/local/bin/vault |
| Safety | 10/10 | Excellent confirmation prompts |
| Idempotency | 10/10 | All operations safe to re-run |
| Error Handling | 10/10 | Comprehensive, non-fatal errors |
| Logging | 10/10 | Structured, detailed logging |
| Edge Cases | 10/10 | Handles missing files, failed states |
| Code Quality | 10/10 | Clean separation, follows patterns |
| Testing | 7/10 | No unit tests for uninstall |

**The implementation is actually EXCELLENT** - it's more comprehensive than the requirements document. The only issue is the binary path inconsistency which is a trivial fix.

---

##  RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate (Do Now)
1. Fix binary path issue (add `/usr/local/bin/vault` to purge paths)
2. Test complete removal flow
3. Verify reinstallation works

### Short Term (Nice to Have)
1. Add unit tests for `VaultUninstaller`
2. Fix deprecated Capabilities= in install.go
3. Add integration test: install ‚Üí delete ‚Üí install

### Long Term (Consider)
1. Add `--dry-run` flag to show what would be removed
2. Add backup option before deletion
3. Create migration tool for upgrades vs full removal
