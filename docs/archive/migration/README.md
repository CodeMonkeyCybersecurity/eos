## Migration Timeline

### Phase 1-10: SaltStack to HashiCorp Migration
**Date:** September 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  

**Key Achievements:**
- Migrated from SaltStack to HashiCorp stack (Consul, Nomad, Vault)
- Established administrator escalation patterns for system-level operations
- Implemented HashiCorp-based service discovery and orchestration
- Completed Vault integration for secret management
- Removed SaltStack dependencies across entire codebase

## Key Migration Decisions

### Architecture Changes
1. **SaltStack → HashiCorp Stack**
   - Consul for service discovery
   - Nomad for container orchestration
   - Vault for secret management

2. **Administrator Escalation Pattern**
   - System-level operations require administrator intervention
   - Clear security boundaries
   - Audit trails for compliance

3. **Documentation Consolidation**
   - Implementation details moved inline with code
   - Quick reference files in docs/
   - Historical docs archived

### Lessons Learned
1. **Systematic Approach Works** - Phased migration with clear milestones
2. **Adversarial Review Valuable** - Challenging decisions improves quality
3. **Documentation Matters** - Inline docs stay current with code
4. **Security First** - Administrator escalation prevents privilege issues
