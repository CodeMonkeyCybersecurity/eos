func isValidUsername(username string) bool {
    validUsername := regexp.MustCompile(`^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$`)
    return validUsername.MatchString(username) && len(username) <= 32
}
```

resp, err := client.Get(ctx, url)

// Enhanced configuration
config := httpclient.SecurityConfig()
config.AuthConfig.Type = httpclient.AuthTypeBearer
config.AuthConfig.Token = token
client, _ := httpclient.NewClient(config)
