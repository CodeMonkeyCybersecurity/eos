# Phase 9: Framework Implementation Report

## Overview

Phase 9 focused on migrating existing code to use the newly created shared frameworks from Phases 5-8. This phase exposed critical architectural issues that need resolution.

## Migration Progress

### Successful Migrations

1. **Service Management Framework**
   - **nginx/nginx.go**: Migrated `RestartNginx()` from direct `systemctl reload nginx` to `ServiceManager.Reload()`
   - **cmd/delete/pipeline_servies.go**: Migrated `systemctl daemon-reload` to `ServiceManager.DaemonReload()`
   - **pkg/service_installation/qemu_guest.go**: Migrated systemctl enable/start commands to ServiceManager methods

2. **File Operations Framework**
   - **docker_volume/create.go**: Migrated `os.WriteFile()` to `shared.SafeWriteFile()`
   - **system_config/manager.go**: Migrated file existence check from `os.Stat()` to `shared.FileExists()`

### Migration Summary

| Framework | Files Migrated | Commands Replaced | Status |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| Service Management | 3 | 5 systemctl calls |  Complete |
| File Operations | 2 | 2 file ops |  Complete |
| Configuration Management | 0 | 0 | ⏳ Blocked by import cycle |
| Testing Framework | 1 | N/A | ⚠️ Fixed import references |

## Critical Issues Discovered

### Import Cycle Problem

**Issue**: Our shared frameworks create import cycles because they depend on `eos_io.RuntimeContext`:

```
eos_io → shared → eos_io (CYCLE!)
```

**Root Cause**: 
- `shared/service.go` and `shared/config.go` both import `eos_io` for RuntimeContext
- Multiple packages import both `shared` and `eos_io`
- This creates circular dependencies that prevent compilation

**Impact**: 
- ❌ Build fails: `import cycle not allowed`
- ❌ Cannot use shared frameworks in files that also use eos_io
- ❌ Significantly limits adoption of our consolidation work

### Architectural Design Flaw

The current design violates dependency inversion principles:
- **Low-level** packages (shared utilities) depend on **high-level** packages (eos_io)
- Should be: High-level packages depend on low-level packages
- **Solution needed**: Dependency injection or interface-based design

## Required Fixes

### Phase 9a: Resolve Import Cycles

1. **Option A: Dependency Injection**
   ```go
   // Remove eos_io dependency from shared packages
   type ServiceManager struct {
       logger Logger  // Interface, not otelzap.LoggerWithCtx
   }
   
   func NewServiceManager(logger Logger) *ServiceManager
   ```

2. **Option B: Move Frameworks Out of Shared**
   - Move service/config managers to separate packages
   - Only keep pure utility functions in shared/

3. **Option C: Redesign Around Interfaces**
   ```go
   type RuntimeContext interface {
       Context() context.Context
       Logger() Logger
   }
   ```

### Phase 9b: Complete Migration

Once import cycles are resolved:
- Migrate remaining 86 exec.Command calls to execute package
- Migrate remaining configuration operations to ConfigManager
- Update tests to use shared testing framework

## Code Quality Verification

**Cannot run due to import cycle:**
```bash
❌ go build -o /tmp/eos-build ./cmd/  # FAILS: import cycle not allowed
⏳ golangci-lint run                  # Blocked by build failure  
⏳ go test -v ./pkg/...               # Blocked by build failure
```

## Next Steps

1. **URGENT**: Fix import cycle issues (Phase 9a)
2. **Continue**: Complete framework migration (Phase 9b)
3. **Verify**: Run full test suite and linting
4. **Document**: Update architecture documentation

## Lessons Learned

1. **Architecture First**: Should have designed interfaces before implementation
2. **Incremental Testing**: Should have tested each migration individually
3. **Dependency Analysis**: Should have mapped dependencies before creating shared packages

## Migration Benefits (Once Fixed)

-  **Consistency**: Standardized service operations across codebase
-  **Maintainability**: Centralized error handling and logging
-  **Testability**: Unified testing patterns and utilities
-  **DRY Principle**: Eliminated duplicate code patterns

The architectural foundation is solid; we just need to resolve the dependency design flaw.
