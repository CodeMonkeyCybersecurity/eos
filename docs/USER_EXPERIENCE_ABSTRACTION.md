# Eos User Experience Abstraction Implementation

> **📝 Documentation has been moved inline with the code for better maintainability.**
> 
> The comprehensive user experience abstraction documentation is now embedded directly in the Go source files where the functionality is implemented. This ensures the documentation stays current with code changes and is immediately available to developers.

## Quick Reference

For detailed user experience abstraction documentation, see the inline comments in these files:

- **CLI Abstraction**: `pkg/cli/cli.go` - Complete user experience abstraction implementation and dual-layer deployment
- **Create Commands**: `cmd/create/` - Service creation commands with abstracted interface
- **Shared Utilities**: `pkg/shared/` - Shared CLI utilities and patterns
- **Bootstrap System**: `pkg/bootstrap/` - Infrastructure bootstrapping with user abstraction
- **Service Classification**: `pkg/orchestrator/` - Automatic service classification and deployment routing

## Abstraction Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Date:** September 20, 2025  
**Dual-Layer Deployment:** ✅ TRANSPARENT ORCHESTRATION ACTIVE  
**Service Classification:** ✅ AUTOMATIC ROUTING OPERATIONAL  
**User Interface:** ✅ CONSISTENT INTERFACE ACROSS ALL SERVICES

The Eos user experience abstraction provides a consistent `eos create X` interface regardless of underlying orchestration technology, with automatic service classification and transparent dual-layer deployment.
