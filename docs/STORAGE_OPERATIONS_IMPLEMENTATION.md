# Storage Operations Implementation

*Last Updated: 2025-01-19*

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of comprehensive storage operations functionality in EOS, based on the requirements outlined in storage_ops.md.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Environment Detection (`pkg/environment/`)
- **detector.go**: Detects infrastructure scale and assigns machine roles
- **types.go**: Defines environment scales and storage profiles
- Supports single machine, small (2-3), medium (4-6), and distributed (7+) deployments
- Automatically adjusts thresholds based on environment scale

### 2. Threshold Management (`pkg/storage/threshold/`)
- **manager.go**: Manages storage thresholds and determines actions
- **actions.go**: Executes progressive actions (compress, cleanup, degrade, emergency)
- Progressive action levels:
  - Warning (60-70%): Enhanced monitoring
  - Compress (70-80%): Compress logs and old files
  - Cleanup (75-85%): Remove expendable files
  - Degrade (80-90%): Stop non-critical services
  - Emergency (85-93%): Aggressive cleanup
  - Critical (90-95%): Emergency recovery mode

### 3. Storage Analyzer (`pkg/storage/analyzer/`)
- **analyzer.go**: Core analysis engine with monitoring capabilities
- **classifier.go**: Classifies data by importance (critical/important/standard/expendable)
- Monitors all mount points
- Calculates growth rates
- Triggers automatic actions based on thresholds

### 4. Filesystem Detection (`pkg/storage/filesystem/`)
- **detector.go**: Detects filesystem types and provides recommendations
- Recommends optimal filesystems for workloads:
  - Database: XFS
  - Container: ext4
  - Backup: Btrfs
  - Distributed: CephFS
- Provides filesystem-specific optimizations

### 5. Emergency Recovery (`pkg/storage/emergency/`)
- **recovery.go**: Handles critical storage situations
- Emergency actions include:
  - Stopping non-critical services
  - Clearing all temporary files
  - Removing package caches
  - Aggressive log cleanup
  - Docker system prune
- Generates diagnostics reports

### 6. CLI Commands

#### Read Commands
- `eos read storage-monitor`: Monitor storage with threshold-based actions
- `eos read storage-analyze`: Comprehensive storage analysis

#### Update Commands
- `eos update storage-cleanup`: Manual cleanup at various levels
- `eos update storage-emergency`: Emergency recovery operations

#### Create Commands
- `eos create storage-provision`: Provision new storage with smart defaults

## Usage Examples

### Basic Analysis
```bash
# Analyze current storage state
eos read storage-analyze

# Detailed analysis with optimization suggestions
eos read storage-analyze --detailed
```

### Monitoring
```bash
# Single analysis run
eos read storage-monitor

# Run as monitoring daemon
eos read storage-monitor --daemon --interval=5m
```

### Cleanup Operations
```bash
# Compress old files
eos update storage-cleanup --level=compress

# Standard cleanup
eos update storage-cleanup --level=cleanup

# Aggressive cleanup (stops services)
eos update storage-cleanup --level=aggressive

# Emergency mode
eos update storage-cleanup --level=emergency --force
```

### Emergency Recovery
```bash
# Generate diagnostics only
eos update storage-emergency --diagnostics

# Perform emergency recovery
eos update storage-emergency --recover
```

### Storage Provisioning
```bash
# Interactive provisioning
eos create storage-provision

# Provision for specific workload
eos create storage-provision --workload=database --size=500G --path=/mnt/db
```

## Configuration

Default configuration is provided in `/opt/eos/configs/storage-ops.yaml`:
- Data classification rules
- Cleanup policies
- Emergency procedures
- Filesystem-specific settings
- Environment-specific overrides

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Environment-Aware**: Automatically adjusts behavior based on deployment scale
2. **Progressive Actions**: Takes measured steps before drastic actions
3. **Data Safety**: Classifies data to prevent accidental deletion of critical files
4. **Filesystem Optimization**: Recommends and configures optimal filesystems
5. **Emergency Recovery**: Automated recovery from disk-full scenarios

## Integration Points

### Salt Integration (Future)
- Generate Salt states for storage configuration
- Deploy monitoring across multiple nodes
- Coordinate distributed storage operations

### Prometheus Metrics (Future)
- Export storage usage metrics
- Track growth rates
- Alert on threshold violations

### Backup Integration (Future)
- Coordinate with backup systems before cleanup
- Ensure critical data is backed up
- Restore from backups in emergencies

## Next Steps

1. Implement container storage management for Docker/Nomad
2. Add Salt state generation for automated deployment
3. Integrate with existing backup commands
4. Add Prometheus metrics export
5. Create distributed storage balancing for large deployments
