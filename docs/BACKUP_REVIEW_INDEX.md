### 2. BACKUP_ADVERSARIAL_ANALYSIS.md (Detailed Technical Analysis)
**Read this for complete technical details.** Comprehensive vulnerability analysis with code examples.

**Sections:**
- Executive summary (critical issues, P0/P1/P2 breakdown)
- P0 Breaking Issues (5 critical security/functionality issues)
  - P0-1: Password exposure via environment variables (CVSS 7.5)
  - P0-2: Local password storage completely unimplemented
  - P0-3: Restore-to-root system default (CVSS 8.2)
  - P0-4: Hook command whitelist insufficient
  - P0-5: Missing constants file (architectural violation)
- P1 Critical Issues (4 functionality issues)
  - P1-1: Fake TODO implementations breaking AIE pattern
  - P1-2: Restore business logic in cmd/ violating architecture
  - P1-3: Incomplete error context for troubleshooting
  - P1-4: Notification features non-functional
- P2 Important Issues (2 resilience issues)
  - P2-1: Missing retry logic for transient errors
  - P2-2: Configuration YAML lacks validation
- P3 Recommended Issues
  - Architecture inconsistencies
  - Restic version compatibility
- Comprehensive findings table
- Restic best practices compliance analysis
- Security vulnerabilities summary (CVSS scores)
- Migration path to production (4 phases)
- Immediate action items

### 3. BACKUP_FIXES_REQUIRED.md (Implementation Guide)
**Read this to understand how to fix each issue.** Specific code changes with before/after examples.

**Sections:**
- P0-1: Password exposure fix (use RESTIC_PASSWORD_FILE)
- P0-2: Local password storage implementation
- P0-3: Restore-to-root safety fix (change default, add validation)
- P0-4: Hook whitelist proper implementation (EvalSymlinks)
- P0-5: Constants file creation (pkg/backup/constants.go)
- P1-1: Real Assess/Intervene/Evaluate implementation
- P1-2: Move restore logic from cmd/ to pkg/
- Testing requirements for each fix

## Quick Navigation

### If you have 5 minutes:
Read **BACKUP_REVIEW_SUMMARY.txt** - covers all critical findings and DO NOT USE items.

### If you have 15 minutes:
Read **BACKUP_REVIEW_SUMMARY.txt** + **BACKUP_ADVERSARIAL_ANALYSIS.md** sections for your area of concern (P0, P1, or P2).

### If you have 30 minutes:
Read all of **BACKUP_ADVERSARIAL_ANALYSIS.md** for complete technical context.

### If you're implementing fixes:
Read **BACKUP_FIXES_REQUIRED.md** for specific code changes and testing requirements.

## Key Findings

### Most Critical Issues
1. **Password Exposure (CVSS 7.5)** - Encryption keys visible in process list
2. **Restore-to-Root Default (CVSS 8.2)** - Can destroy system with single command
3. **Hook Whitelist Bypass (CVSS 6.3)** - RCE via symlink attacks

### Worst Architectural Issues
1. **Unimplemented Fallback** - Local password storage returns success without saving
2. **Fake Implementations** - AIE pattern broken, operations report success without validation
3. **Business Logic in cmd/** - 184-line cmd file violating architecture rules
4. **No Constants File** - Hardcoded values violate CLAUDE.md P0 rule

### Missing Features
- Email/Slack/webhook notifications (non-functional)
- Dry-run mode (fake)
- Repository health checks
- Disk space pre-flight checks
- Error retry logic
- Restic version checking

## Severity Assessment

| Category | Count | Total |
|----------|-------|-------|
| P0 Breaking | 5 | 5 |
| P1 Critical | 4 | 4 |
| P2 Important | 2 | 2 |
| **Total** | | **11** |

**Not production-ready. All P0 issues must be fixed before deployment.**

## Timeline

### Phase 1 (3-4 days): Fix P0 Issues
1. Implement constants.go
2. Fix password file storage
3. Change restore default
4. Fix hook whitelist
5. Migrate password delivery

### Phase 2 (3-4 days): Fix P1 Issues
1. Implement real AIE
2. Move restore logic to pkg/
3. Add error context
4. Implement notifications

### Phase 3 (3-4 days): Fix P2 + Hardening
1. Add retry logic
2. Add YAML validation
3. Refactor cmd/ files
4. Add integration tests

### Phase 4 (2-3 days): Production Validation
1. Load testing
2. Security audit
3. Documentation
4. Canary deployment

## Current Safe Operations (With Caveats)
- Backup to local repository (password management concern)
- List/read operations (view-only)
- File backup operations (single files)

## Operations to Avoid
- Restore (dangerous default)
- Notifications (not implemented)
- Vault unavailable scenarios (password storage broken)
- Hook commands (whitelist bypassable)

## Next Steps

1. **Read** BACKUP_REVIEW_SUMMARY.txt (5 min)
2. **Review** BACKUP_ADVERSARIAL_ANALYSIS.md (20 min)
3. **Plan** fixes using BACKUP_FIXES_REQUIRED.md
4. **Implement** P0 fixes first (3-4 days)
5. **Test** each fix comprehensively
6. **Audit** security before production use
