# Eos Bootstrap State Validation Architecture

> ** Documentation has been moved inline with the code for better maintainability.**
> 
> The comprehensive bootstrap state validation documentation is now embedded directly in the Go source files where the functionality is implemented. This ensures the documentation stays current with code changes and is immediately available to developers.

## Quick Reference

For detailed bootstrap state validation documentation, see the inline comments in these files:

- **State Validator**: `pkg/bootstrap/state_validator.go` - Complete bootstrap state validation architecture
- **Bootstrap Orchestrator**: `pkg/bootstrap/orchestrator.go` - Bootstrap phase orchestration and management
- **Bootstrap Check**: `pkg/bootstrap/check.go` - Bootstrap system validation and requirements
- **State Detection**: `pkg/bootstrap/state_detection.go` - Service and component state detection
- **Bootstrap Detector**: `pkg/bootstrap/detector.go` - Cluster detection and service discovery

## Validation Status:  IMPLEMENTED

**Date:** September 20, 2025  
**State-Based Validation:**  HASHICORP STACK INTEGRATION OPERATIONAL  
**Adaptive Bootstrap:**  INTELLIGENT PHASE DETECTION ACTIVE  
**Service Discovery:**  CONSUL/NOMAD/VAULT HEALTH VALIDATION IMPLEMENTED

The Eos bootstrap system uses state-based validation instead of arbitrary marker files, ensuring bootstrap completion through actual system state verification using HashiCorp stack APIs.
