# ADR-0001 Template - <Title>

Use this template for all EOS ADRs. Keep entries concise, link to related code or issues, and reflect the "solve once, systematize" philosophy by codifying repeatable decisions.

## Context

- Constraints (security, compliance, timelines), affected services, and relevant user infrastructure preferences.
- Existing options considered and why they are insufficient.

## Decision

- Interfaces, contracts, and ownership (who drives, who reviews).
- How this aligns with EOS "Human Technology" principles (human-centric, evidence-based, sustainable innovation).

## Consequences
- Positive outcomes (risk reduction, usability, maintainability).
- Trade-offs and known risks.
- Follow-up tasks, monitoring, and rollout plan.

## Status
- Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
- Link to superseding ADR if applicable.

## Date
