# EOS Helper Function Migration Summary

This document summarizes the migration of helper functions from `cmd/` to `pkg/` following the Assessment-Intervention-Evaluation (AIE) pattern and DRY principles.

## Key Architectural Changes

### 1. Assessment-Intervention-Evaluation Pattern (`pkg/patterns/aie.go`)

Created a comprehensive AIE framework that ensures all operations follow the security model:

- **Assessment**: Check if operation can proceed (permissions, prerequisites, current state)
- **Intervention**: Perform the actual operation with proper logging and error handling
- **Evaluation**: Verify the operation completed successfully with validation checks

Benefits:
- Consistent error handling across all operations
- Built-in rollback support for failed operations
- Comprehensive logging and audit trails
- Standardized validation patterns

### 2. Salt Stack Integration (`pkg/saltstack/`)

Created secure infrastructure management via Salt Stack:

- **`client.go`**: Core Salt client for secure remote operations
- **`hashicorp.go`**: HashiCorp tools (Terraform, Vault, Consul, Nomad) deployment via Salt states

Benefits:
- Secure, authenticated remote operations
- Declarative infrastructure as code
- Audit trails for all infrastructure changes
- Centralized configuration management

### 3. Migrated Helper Modules

#### Backup Operations (`pkg/backup/operations.go`)
- **HookOperation**: AIE pattern for backup hooks
- **BackupOperation**: AIE pattern for backup execution
- **NotificationOperation**: AIE pattern for notifications

Migrated from:
- `cmd/backup/update.go` functions: `runHook()`, `sendNotification()`

#### User Management (`pkg/users/operations.go`)
- **UserExistenceCheck**: AIE pattern for checking user existence
- **UserCreationOperation**: AIE pattern for secure user creation
- **PasswordUpdateOperation**: AIE pattern for password updates
- **UserDeletionOperation**: AIE pattern for user deletion
- **Utility functions**: `GenerateSecurePassword()`, `GetSystemUsers()`

Migrated from:
- `cmd/create/user.go`: `assessUserExistence()`, `generateSecurePassword()`, `storeUserPasswordInVault()`, `evaluateUserCreation()`
- `cmd/read/users.go`: `getSystemUsers()`, `contains()`
- `cmd/update/users.go`: password update functions

#### System Service Management (`pkg/system/service_operations.go`)
- **ServiceOperation**: AIE pattern for systemd service operations
- **SleepDisableOperation**: AIE pattern for disabling system sleep
- **PortKillOperation**: AIE pattern for killing processes by port
- **Helper functions**: `ManageService()`, `DisableSystemSleep()`, `KillProcessesByPort()`

Migrated from:
- `cmd/disable/suspension.go`: `disableSystemdTargets()`, `maskSleepTargets()`, `disableLogindSleep()`
- `cmd/disable/vault.go`: `systemctl()`, `killByPort()`
- Various other files with systemctl wrappers

## Updated Command Files

### 1. `cmd/backup/update.go`
**Before**: Contained inline implementations of hook execution and notifications
**After**: Uses modular `pkg/backup/operations.go` functions with AIE pattern

Key changes:
- `runHook()` → `backup.RunHook()` with AIE pattern
- `sendNotification()` → `backup.SendNotification()` with AIE pattern
- Added `BackupOperation` AIE pattern for main backup logic

### 2. `cmd/disable/suspension.go`
**Before**: Contained inline systemd operations with basic error handling
**After**: Uses modular `pkg/system/service_operations.go` with AIE pattern

Key changes:
- Removed `disableSystemdTargets()`, `maskSleepTargets()`, `disableLogindSleep()`
- Now uses `system.DisableSystemSleep()` with comprehensive AIE validation
- Added Salt Stack integration for secure operations

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. DRY Principle Compliance
- **Before**: Multiple files had their own systemctl wrappers
- **After**: Single `ManageService()` function in `pkg/system/`

- **Before**: Duplicate password generation across multiple commands
- **After**: Single `GenerateSecurePassword()` function in `pkg/users/`

- **Before**: Multiple notification implementations
- **After**: Single `NotificationOperation` with AIE pattern

### 2. Enhanced Security
- All operations now follow AIE pattern for comprehensive validation
- Salt Stack integration provides secure, authenticated remote operations
- Vault integration for secure credential storage
- Comprehensive audit logging for all operations

### 3. Improved Modularity
- Clear separation between command orchestration (`cmd/`) and business logic (`pkg/`)
- Reusable operations across multiple commands
- Standardized error handling and logging patterns
- Easy testing of individual operations

### 4. Better Error Handling
- Consistent error patterns across all operations
- Built-in rollback support for complex operations
- Detailed validation with specific failure reasons
- Structured logging with operation context

## Integration with HashiCorp Tools

The Salt Stack integration enables secure deployment and management of:

- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code with backend configuration
- **Vault**: Secure secrets management with TLS configuration
- **Consul**: Service discovery and configuration with encryption
- **Nomad**: Workload orchestration with Vault integration

All deployments follow the AIE pattern:
1. **Assess**: Check Salt connectivity and prerequisites
2. **Intervene**: Apply Salt states with proper configuration
3. **Evaluate**: Verify services are running and properly configured

## Future Migration Opportunities

Based on the analysis, remaining candidates for migration include:

1. **Vault Cleanup Operations** (`cmd/delete/vault_secure.go`)
   - `stopVaultServices()`, `removeVaultPackages()`, `purgeVaultFiles()`
   - Should be moved to `pkg/vault/cleanup.go` with AIE pattern

2. **Docker Backup Helpers** (`cmd/backup/docker.go`)
   - `parseDockerBackupFlags()`, `logBackupResults()`
   - Should be moved to `pkg/backup/docker_helpers.go`

3. **DNS Operations** (`cmd/hecate/create/hetzner/dns.go`)
   - `getZoneIDForDomain()`, `createRecord()`
   - Should be moved to `pkg/hetzner/dns_helpers.go`

4. **File Update Operations** (`cmd/hecate/update/jenkins.go`)
   - `updateFilesInDir()` with token replacement
   - Should be moved to `pkg/domain/fileops/update_operations.go`

## Verification

All migrated packages compile successfully:
```bash
go build -v ./pkg/patterns ./pkg/saltstack ./pkg/backup ./pkg/users ./pkg/system
```

Command files using migrated helpers also compile without errors, demonstrating successful integration of the new modular architecture.

## Conclusion

This migration successfully transforms EOS from a monolithic command structure to a modular, secure, and maintainable architecture. The AIE pattern ensures all operations are performed securely with proper validation, while Salt Stack integration provides enterprise-grade infrastructure management capabilities.

The new architecture makes EOS more:
- **Secure**: AIE pattern with comprehensive validation
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns and DRY compliance  
- **Scalable**: Modular components that can be easily extended
- **Auditable**: Comprehensive logging and Salt Stack state management
- **Testable**: Isolated operations that can be independently tested
