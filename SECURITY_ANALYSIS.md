# Critical Security Issues Found in Eos Codebase

## Overview

During analysis of the Eos codebase, several critical security vulnerabilities were identified that pose immediate risks to system safety and integrity. This document outlines the most severe issues and their fixes.

## ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL SEVERITY ISSUES

### 1. Command Injection Vulnerability (FIXED)
**Location**: `cmd/delete/vault.go` (original)
**Vulnerability**: The `run()` function executed commands via `exec.Command()` without proper input sanitization
**Risk**: Complete system compromise through arbitrary command execution
**Fix**: Replaced with secure `execute.RunSimple()` calls that properly handle arguments

### 2. Incomplete Vault Deletion (FIXED)
**Location**: `cmd/delete/vault.go`
**Issue**: Vault deletion left critical state and services running, causing conflicts on reinstallation
**Risk**: Service conflicts, credential leakage, incomplete cleanup of sensitive data
**Fix**: Created comprehensive `vault-secure` delete command with:
- Proper service stopping and disabling
- Complete file and directory cleanup
- System hardening artifact removal
- Verification of cleanup completion
- Optional eos user removal

### 3. Privilege Escalation Flaw
**Location**: `pkg/eos_unix/permissions.go:CheckSudo()`
**Issue**: Missing "sudo" command in privilege check
```go
cmd := exec.Command("-n", "true") // Missing "sudo"!
```
**Risk**: Privilege checks fail silently, potentially running privileged operations without authorization
**Status**: IDENTIFIED - Needs immediate fix

### 4. Global Kill Switch
**Location**: `cmd/root.go:116-125`
**Issue**: Uncontrolled goroutine sends SIGKILL bypassing cleanup
```go
syscall.Kill(syscall.Getpid(), syscall.SIGKILL) // Forceful kill
```
**Risk**: Resource leaks, incomplete operations, data corruption
**Status**: IDENTIFIED - Needs graceful shutdown mechanism

### 5. Secrets Exposure in Logs
**Location**: `pkg/vault/auth.go:153`
**Issue**: Token prefixes logged in structured logs
**Risk**: Credential leakage through log aggregation systems
**Status**: IDENTIFIED - Remove all credential data from logs

## ðŸš¨ HIGH SEVERITY ISSUES

### 6. Inadequate Input Validation
**Location**: `pkg/shared/input_validation.go`
**Issues**:
- Path validation blocks legitimate system directories
- Regex patterns don't prevent all injection vectors
- No length limits on many user inputs

### 7. Testing Coverage Crisis
**Statistics**: ~5% test coverage (16 test files vs 302+ Go files)
**Critical gaps**:
- No security testing for command execution
- No privilege escalation testing  
- Missing integration tests for Vault operations

## FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Secure Vault Deletion
- **New command**: `eos delete vault-secure`
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive service stopping
  - Complete file cleanup with verification
  - System hardening artifact removal
  - Optional eos user cleanup
  - Force mode for error recovery
  - Verification of cleanup completion

### 2. Command Injection Prevention
- Removed vulnerable `run()` function
- Replaced all direct `exec.Command` calls with secure `execute.RunSimple()`
- Added proper error handling and logging

### 3. Enhanced Logging
- All fixes use structured logging with `otelzap.Ctx()`
- No credential data in logs
- Proper error context and debugging information

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

1. **Fix privilege escalation** in `pkg/eos_unix/permissions.go`
2. **Replace SIGKILL with graceful shutdown** in `cmd/root.go`
3. **Remove all credential logging** throughout codebase
4. **Add comprehensive security tests**
5. **Review all command execution** for injection vulnerabilities

## USAGE

### Secure Vault Deletion
```bash
# Standard secure deletion
sudo eos delete vault-secure

# Include eos user removal
sudo eos delete vault-secure --remove-user

# Force continue on errors
sudo eos delete vault-secure --force

# Skip file purging (not recommended)
sudo eos delete vault-secure --no-purge
```

### Verification
After deletion, verify no critical files remain:
```bash
# Check for services
systemctl list-units | grep vault

# Check for processes  
ps aux | grep vault

# Check for critical files
ls /etc/vault* /etc/systemd/system/vault* 2>/dev/null
```

## TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Security testing** for all command execution paths
2. **Privilege escalation testing** for all sudo operations
3. **Integration testing** for complete Vault lifecycle
4. **Fuzzing tests** for input validation
5. **Static analysis** for additional vulnerabilities

The new secure delete command addresses the immediate Vault state persistence issues while implementing proper security practices throughout.
