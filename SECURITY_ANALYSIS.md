# Critical Security Issues Found and Fixed in Eos Codebase

## Overview

During comprehensive analysis of the Eos codebase, several critical security vulnerabilities were identified that posed immediate risks to system safety and integrity. **ALL CRITICAL ISSUES HAVE BEEN FIXED** as of this security audit. This document outlines the severe issues found and their implemented fixes.

## ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL SEVERITY ISSUES

### 1. Command Injection Vulnerability (FIXED âœ…)
**Location**: `pkg/execute/execute.go`, `cmd/delete/vault.go`
**Vulnerability**: 
- Shell execution mode allowed arbitrary command injection via `bash -c`
- Unsafe `run()` function with direct command concatenation
**Risk**: Complete system compromise through arbitrary command execution
**Fix**: 
- Disabled shell execution mode in `execute.Run()` with security error
- Disabled `RunShell()` function entirely
- Replaced unsafe `run()` calls with secure `execute.RunSimple()` 
- All command execution now uses proper argument arrays

### 2. Incomplete Vault Deletion (FIXED)
**Location**: `cmd/delete/vault.go`
**Issue**: Vault deletion left critical state and services running, causing conflicts on reinstallation
**Risk**: Service conflicts, credential leakage, incomplete cleanup of sensitive data
**Fix**: Created comprehensive `vault-secure` delete command with:
- Proper service stopping and disabling
- Complete file and directory cleanup
- System hardening artifact removal
- Verification of cleanup completion
- Optional eos user removal

### 3. Privilege Escalation Flaw (FIXED âœ…)
**Location**: `pkg/eos_unix/permissions.go`
**Issue**: Multiple broken sudo functions missing "sudo" command
**Risk**: Privilege checks fail silently, potentially running privileged operations without authorization
**Fix**: 
- Fixed `CheckSudo()` to include "sudo" command and correct return logic
- Fixed `RequireRootInteractive()` to use proper "sudo -v"
- Fixed `CanInteractiveSudo()` to use proper "sudo -v" 
- Fixed `CheckSudoersMembership()` to use sudo for safe file access
- All sudo operations now properly authenticated

### 4. Global Kill Switch (FIXED âœ…)
**Location**: `cmd/root.go`
**Issue**: Uncontrolled goroutine sends SIGKILL bypassing cleanup
**Risk**: Resource leaks, incomplete operations, data corruption
**Fix**: 
- Replaced SIGKILL with graceful shutdown using context cancellation
- Added 5-second cleanup window before normal exit
- Removed syscall import and dangerous kill operation
- Watchdog now properly handles context cancellation
- Normal exit(1) instead of forceful SIGKILL

### 5. Secrets Exposure in Logs (FIXED âœ…)
**Location**: Multiple files in `pkg/vault/`
**Issue**: Extensive credential logging including full tokens, role IDs, and secret IDs
**Risk**: Credential leakage through log aggregation systems
**Fix**: 
- Removed all `zap.String("token_prefix", ...)` logging across 9 vault files
- Removed full credential logging from AppRole operations 
- Removed sensitive data prefixes (QR codes, backup keys, etc.)
- Maintained functional logging without exposing sensitive data
- Comprehensive audit and cleanup of all vault logging

## ðŸš¨ HIGH SEVERITY ISSUES

### 6. Inadequate Input Validation
**Location**: `pkg/shared/input_validation.go`
**Issues**:
- Path validation blocks legitimate system directories
- Regex patterns don't prevent all injection vectors
- No length limits on many user inputs

### 7. Testing Coverage Crisis
**Statistics**: ~5% test coverage (16 test files vs 302+ Go files)
**Critical gaps**:
- No security testing for command execution
- No privilege escalation testing  
- Missing integration tests for Vault operations

## FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Secure Vault Deletion
- **New command**: `eos delete vault-secure`
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive service stopping
  - Complete file cleanup with verification
  - System hardening artifact removal
  - Optional eos user cleanup
  - Force mode for error recovery
  - Verification of cleanup completion

### 2. Command Injection Prevention
- Removed vulnerable `run()` function
- Replaced all direct `exec.Command` calls with secure `execute.RunSimple()`
- Added proper error handling and logging

### 3. Enhanced Logging
- All fixes use structured logging with `otelzap.Ctx()`
- No credential data in logs
- Proper error context and debugging information

## âœ… CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED

### Security Fixes Implemented:

1. **âœ… Fixed privilege escalation** in `pkg/eos_unix/permissions.go`
   - All sudo functions now properly use "sudo" command
   - Correct return logic for privilege checks
   - Safe file access patterns implemented

2. **âœ… Replaced SIGKILL with graceful shutdown** in `cmd/root.go`
   - Context-aware cleanup with 5-second grace period
   - Removed dangerous syscall.Kill operation
   - Proper resource cleanup on timeout

3. **âœ… Removed all credential logging** throughout codebase
   - Comprehensive audit of vault package logging
   - Eliminated token, credential, and secret exposure
   - Maintained debugging functionality without sensitive data

4. **âœ… Fixed command injection vulnerabilities**
   - Disabled shell execution mode in execute package
   - Disabled RunShell function entirely
   - Replaced unsafe command concatenation with argument arrays

5. **âœ… Enhanced Vault deletion security**
   - Comprehensive cleanup of services, files, and state
   - Verification of cleanup completion
   - Secure credential handling during deletion

## REMAINING ACTIONS RECOMMENDED

1. **Add comprehensive security tests** for all fixed vulnerabilities
2. **Implement input validation improvements** 
3. **Add static security analysis** to CI/CD pipeline
4. **Regular security audits** of command execution paths

## USAGE

### Secure Vault Deletion
```bash
# Standard secure deletion
sudo eos delete vault-secure

# Include eos user removal
sudo eos delete vault-secure --remove-user

# Force continue on errors
sudo eos delete vault-secure --force

# Skip file purging (not recommended)
sudo eos delete vault-secure --no-purge
```

### Verification
After deletion, verify no critical files remain:
```bash
# Check for services
systemctl list-units | grep vault

# Check for processes  
ps aux | grep vault

# Check for critical files
ls /etc/vault* /etc/systemd/system/vault* 2>/dev/null
```

## TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Security testing** for all command execution paths
2. **Privilege escalation testing** for all sudo operations
3. **Integration testing** for complete Vault lifecycle
4. **Fuzzing tests** for input validation
5. **Static analysis** for additional vulnerabilities

The new secure delete command addresses the immediate Vault state persistence issues while implementing proper security practices throughout.
