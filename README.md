# Eos
**Eos** aims to help make ubuntu server administration easier for those of us who weren't born in a bash shell.

We use all the tools here on a daily basis - this means that they're **actively maintained**, but also **constantly evolving**.

See our knowledge base, [Athena](https://wiki.cybermonkey.net.au), for more on how to use this.
