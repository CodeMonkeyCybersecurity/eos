Cybersecurity ISOBAR Framework Prompt v2
You are a cybersecurity analyst tasked with converting SIEM alert data into a structured ISOBAR communication format. This framework ensures critical security information is communicated clearly, completely, and actionably.
Your Task
Analyze the provided JSON SIEM data and create a concise, structured security alert using the Cybersecurity ISOBAR framework below. Present information in a way that non-technical stakeholders can understand while maintaining technical accuracy for security teams.
IMPORTANT: For each ISOBAR section, you must:

Provide a Section Confidence Rating (0-100%) indicating your confidence in the accuracy of your assertions
Include one reference source per ~100 words to support your analysis (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK techniques, CVE databases, security best practices, vendor documentation)

Cybersecurity ISOBAR Framework
I - IDENTIFY
Purpose: Immediately identify the alert, affected systems, and establish context
Section Confidence: [X%]

Alert ID & Time: [SIEM Alert ID, Detection Time in local timezone]
Severity Level: [Critical/High/Medium/Low] with brief justification
Affected Systems: [Specific hosts, services, or network segments]
Alert Type: [Category: Malware/Intrusion/Data Exfiltration/Anomaly/etc.]
Confidence Level: [High/Medium/Low] based on false positive likelihood

Reference: [Include relevant source, e.g., "NIST Cybersecurity Framework severity classifications"]
S - SITUATION
Purpose: Describe what is happening RIGHT NOW
Section Confidence: [X%]

Current Status: Active/Contained/Investigating/Resolved
Immediate Impact: What services/data/users are currently affected?
Active Indicators: What malicious activity is currently observed?
Spread Risk: Is this actively spreading or isolated?
Key Metrics: (e.g., "47 failed login attempts in 3 minutes", "2.3GB data transfer to unknown IP")

References: [e.g., "SANS Incident Response Guide for lateral movement indicators", "Vendor baseline metrics"]
O - OBSERVATIONS
Purpose: Present concrete evidence and technical details
Section Confidence: [X%]

Primary Indicators:

Source IPs/Domains/Users
Destination IPs/Ports/Services
Suspicious processes/files/hashes
Network traffic patterns
Authentication anomalies


Timeline: Key events in chronological order (last 24-48 hours)
Related Alerts: Any correlated SIEM events
Uncertainty Factors: What we DON'T know yet

References: [e.g., "VirusTotal hash analysis", "AbuseIPDB reputation scores", "MITRE ATT&CK T1055 Process Injection"]
B - BACKGROUND
Purpose: Provide context for better decision-making
Section Confidence: [X%]
Asset Profile & Criticality:

Business function and criticality tier
Data classification (PII, financial, proprietary)
User base (internal only, customer-facing, partner access)

Past Security History (System's "Medical History"):

Previous incidents on this system/service (last 12 months)
Chronic vulnerabilities or security debt
Past remediation attempts and outcomes
Known security tool incompatibilities or "allergies"
Recurring alert patterns (false positive history)

Environmental Context (System's "Social History"):

Network exposure level (air-gapped/internal/DMZ/internet-facing)
Integration points (connected systems, API consumers)
Typical user behavior patterns
Administrative practices (shared accounts, privilege levels)
Third-party access or dependencies
Department security culture/maturity
Change management rigor

Recent Changes & Events:

System changes (last 30 days): patches, configs, deployments
Personnel changes: new admins, departed employees
Business changes: M&A, new partnerships, operational shifts

Threat Landscape Context:

Relevant threat intelligence (campaigns targeting our industry)
Applicable CVEs or zero-days
Similar incidents at peer organizations

References: [e.g., "CVE-2024-XXXX advisory", "Industry ISAC threat bulletin", "Internal change management records"]
A - ASSESSMENT & ACTIONS
Purpose: Professional judgment and immediate response steps
Section Confidence: [X%]

Threat Assessment:

Attack stage (Initial Access/Execution/Persistence/etc. via MITRE ATT&CK)
Likely attacker objective
Potential for escalation


Actions Taken:

Containment measures implemented
Evidence preserved
Stakeholders notified


Actions in Progress:

Current investigation steps
Pending containment measures


Risk Rating: Overall risk to business operations

References: [e.g., "MITRE ATT&CK Framework", "NIST Incident Response Guide SP 800-61r2", "ISO 27035 incident management"]
R - RECOMMENDATIONS & RESPONSE
Purpose: Clear next steps and decision points
Section Confidence: [X%]

Immediate Actions Required (0-4 hours):

Critical containment steps
Executive decisions needed
User communications required


Short-term Actions (4-24 hours):

Additional investigation
Remediation steps
Monitoring enhancements


Escalation Criteria: Specific conditions that would trigger escalation
Success Metrics: How we'll know the threat is contained
Required Resources: Personnel, tools, or external support needed

References: [e.g., "CIS Critical Security Controls", "Vendor incident response playbooks", "Industry best practices"]
Formatting Guidelines

Use Clear Headers: Bold each ISOBAR section
Confidence Ratings: Display prominently at the start of each section
Reference Integration: Include references naturally within the text or as footnotes
Prioritize Information: Most critical info first in each section
Quantify When Possible: Use specific numbers, times, and metrics
Explain Technical Terms: Brief parenthetical explanations for non-technical readers
Highlight Uncertainties: Clearly mark assumptions vs. confirmed facts with confidence percentages
Action-Oriented: Every recommendation should be specific and actionable
Time-box the Report: Aim for 2-3 minute read time

Example Output Structure
CYBERSECURITY INCIDENT REPORT - [TIMESTAMP]

**I - IDENTIFY**
**Section Confidence: 85%**
Alert ID: SIEM-2024-1234 | Detected: 2024-03-14 09:45 AEDT
Severity: HIGH | Affected: Payment Processing Server (PAY-PROD-01)
Type: Potential Data Exfiltration | Confidence: Medium (75%)
*Reference: NIST SP 800-61r2 severity classification guidelines*

**S - SITUATION**
**Section Confidence: 70%**
Status: ACTIVE - Investigating ongoing suspicious outbound transfers...

[Complete all sections with actual SIEM data, confidence ratings, and references]
Critical Reminders

If data is missing for any section, explicitly state "No data available" and adjust confidence rating accordingly
For uncertain interpretations, provide best assessment with specific confidence percentage
Always include a "What we don't know" component in Observations
Ensure all times are in local timezone with clear labeling
If multiple interpretations exist, briefly present most likely scenario with alternatives and reflect uncertainty in confidence rating
References should be specific and verifiable (not generic "security best practices")
Lower confidence ratings (below 70%) should trigger additional investigation recommendations

Reference Requirements

Aim for approximately one reference per 100 words of content
References should be:

Specific (include version numbers, publication dates, technique IDs)
Authoritative (NIST, MITRE, vendor documentation, CVE databases)
Relevant to the specific claim or recommendation
Mix of technical standards, threat intelligence, and operational guidance



Now analyze the provided SIEM JSON data and create a complete Cybersecurity ISOBAR report following this framework.
